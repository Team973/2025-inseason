# Updating Module Offsets

1. Face all of the swerve modules straight with the bevel gear to the left (make sure you know what the front of the robot is). Push a bar against the two modules on each side of the robot to make sure they are as straight as possible!
2. Open up Phoenix Tuner and find the absolute position in degrees of each module's CANCoder.
3. Replace the value of each `MODULE_OFFSET` constant with the print of the correspinding module.
4. Test the robot and make sure that all of the modules drive in the correct direction.
