# Updating Module Offsets

1. Face all of the swerve modules straight with the bevel gear to the left (make sure you know what the front of the robot is). Push a bar against the two modules on each side of the robot to make sure they are as straight as possible!
2. Open up AdvantageScope and find the `Position in Degrees` print of each module.
3. Replace the value of each `MODULE_OFFSET` constant with the print of the correspinding module. (mod0 = Front Left, mod1 = Front Right, mod2 = Back Left, mod3 = Back Right)
4. Test the robot and make sure that all of the modules drive in the correct direction.
